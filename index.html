          <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
            <h4>Key Partners</h4>
            <p> We are our own suppliers. Our key partner would be google due to the sdk for browser extensions we will be creating our product out of. Google will pretty much be doing all the stability that relates between the user and our app.
            </p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Key Activities</h4>
            <p> -A base website for trust as well as any error reporting <br> -The platform would be a chrome extension so it would be entirely client sided</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
            <h4>Value Proposition</h4>
            <p> The price would be minimal. Likely the only foreseeable price would be the one to run a home website.<br> Customization would most likely inclue automatic keying and whether it would be displayed or not for the user to see.</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Customer Relationship</h4>
            <p>Customer relations would almost entirely be non existent after download. It's client side security program so other than error and bug reporting any contact would be minimal. A main website would most likely be necessary for those few needs</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">
            <h4>Customer Segments</h4>
            <p>People who want more security when they send things out onto the internet. They would most likely be people with a slight to extreme paranoia of government or other foreign listeners </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Key Resources</h4>
            <p>it would need to use <br> -Chrome extension sdk<br> -computers<br> - a series of security algorithms <br> -probably will also require a server to run a home website off of</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="2">
            <h4>Channels</h4>
            <p> Open sourced websites and by forum announcement would probably be the best outlets to get the product out. Those people tend to be more technical and more geared to wanting extra security</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Cost Structure</h4>
            <p>  The cost structure would mostly just include the time invested. A website server probably.</p>
          </td>
          <td colspan="5">
            <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
            <p>Currently the product does not actually exist. They would most liekly not have to pay anything from my understanding. Our group hasn't talked about a price so I'm expecting free software.</p>
